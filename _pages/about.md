I am a project scientist working with [Mike Pritchard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikepritchard?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) at the [Department of Earth System Science, UCI](https://www.ess.uci.edu). 

My current research interests are developing and applying multiscale modeling framework (MMF) to study climate science, including: (1) low cloud feecback, (2) aerosol-cloud interaction. This work is deeply collaborative with [Chris Bretherton](https://atmos.uw.edu/~breth/) and [Peter Blossey](https://atmos.uw.edu/~bloss/) at the University of Washington. 

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have been passionately involved in multidisciplinary research, blending atmospheric sciences with oceanography and high-performance computing. My experience encompasses both observational studies and the development of innovative modeling strategies to address complex climate phenomena. 

Feel free to contact me via [email](liranp@uci.edu).
