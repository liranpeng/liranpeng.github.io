Welcome to my website! 

I am a project scientist working with Dr. [Mike Pritchard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikepritchard?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) at the [Department of Earth System Science, UCI](https://www.ess.uci.edu). Before the postdoc, I got my PhD from University of Alaska, Fairbanks in 2019. 

My current research interests are developing and applying multiscale modeling framework (MMF) to study climate science, including: (1) low cloud feecback, (2) aerosol-cloud interaction. This work is deeply collaborative with Chris Bretherton and Peter Blossey at the University of Washington. 

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have been passionately involved in multidisciplinary research, blending atmospheric sciences with oceanography and high-performance computing. My experience encompasses both observational studies and the development of innovative modeling strategies to address complex climate phenomena.
