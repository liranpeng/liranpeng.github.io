Model equations used to either diagnose or prognose the concentration of heterogeneously nucleated ice crystals depend on combinations of cloud temperature, aerosol properties, and elapsed time of supersaturated-vapor or supercooled-liquid conditions. The validity of these equations has been questioned. Among many uncertain factors there is a concern that practical limitations on aerosol particle time of exposure to supercooled-liquid conditions, within ice nucleus counters, has biased the predictions of a diagnostic model equation. In response to this concern, this work analyzes airborne measurements of crystals made within the downwind glaciated portions of wave clouds. A streamline model is used to connect a measurement of aerosol concentration, made upwind of a cloud, to a downwind ice crystal (IC) concentration. Four parameters are derived for 80 streamlines: (1) minimum cloud temperature along the streamline, (2) aerosol particle concentration (diameter, D > 0.5 μm) measured within ascending air upwind of the cloud, (3) IC concentration measured in descending air downwind, and (4) the duration of water-saturated conditions along the streamline. The latter are between 38 and 507 s and the minimum temperatures are between −34 and −14 °C. Values of minimum temperature, D > 0.5 μm aerosol concentration, and IC concentration are fitted using the equation developed for ice nucleating particles (INPs) by by DeMott et al. (2010; D10). Overall, there is reasonable agreement among measured IC concentrations, INP concentrations derived using D10's fit equation, and IC concentrations derived by fitting the airborne measurements with the equation developed by D10.
